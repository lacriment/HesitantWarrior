# Hesitant Warrior

A labyrinth solving AI problem. Solved with various algorithms: Backtrack, DFS, BFS, A-Algorithm.

The aim is to move our player(green circle) to the finishing point(pink square). The rules are
the following:
- The player can move horizontally and vertically, one step at a time, but not allowed to step
on black cells.
- The triangles at the sides of the board are death-ray cannons. If a cannon is active, the player
dies if it stands in the row/column of the active death-ray cannon.
- Initially the white cannons are active, then in the next step the black ones

The reason I gave this name to the project is the player is not moving in stable distance, he's hesitant.
